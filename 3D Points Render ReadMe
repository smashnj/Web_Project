3D Points Render:

1. Calculate the centroid from an imported text file with points positions. The format is like "x y z m", where x,y,z represent the position of the point in 3D space and m represents the mass of the point.
x,y,z can be any float value. m should be > 0.
2. Display all the points from the imported text file and centroid;
3. Display all the lines between the centroid with other points;
4. Calculate the cost (sum distance between centroid with other points);
5. Calculate the deviation of centroid in each dimension.
